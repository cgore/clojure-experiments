These are my experiments while learning the [[http://clojure.org][Clojure]] programming language.

- This uses Leiningen from http://leiningen.org/

* 01-hello-world

This demonstrates how to stand up an empty new Clojure project.

You can make the first project by:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein new app hello-world
mv hello-world 01-hello-world
#+END_SRC

The default project from Leiningen actaully is a hello world app, so just run it, you don't need to write any code.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein run
#+END_SRC

If you want to make a .jar file of the project that you can distribute, then run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein uberjar
#+END_SRC

After that, there will be a file 01-hello-world/target/hello-world-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
